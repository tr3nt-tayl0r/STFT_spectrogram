  	<h1>Imagine you’re listening to a song.</h1>
  	 <h2>At any moment, you can hear many notes and sounds at once, but they change over time. <br> Some notes start, others stop. <br> You might hear a guitar, then a drum, then a voice.
  	 <br><br>
	The Fourier Transform is a math tool that can tell you what frequencies (pitches) are in a sound, along with their magnitudes. <br> But there’s a problem: it doesn’t tell you when those sounds happened...  
	<br><br>

	That’s where the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) comes in.
	<br>
	Think of it like this:
	You slide a little window along the audio, like looking at one short moment at a time.

	In each little piece, you use the Fourier Transform to figure out the frequencies.

	Then you move the window a bit and repeat.

	<br>
	It’s like taking snapshots of the sound over time, each showing what pitches were present in that moment.
	<br><br>
	The result?
	You get a spectrogram – a cool picture that shows:
	<ul>
		<li>Time (left to right)</li>

		<li>Pitch (up and down)</li>

		<li>Loudness (color or brightness)</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	It’s like turning sound into a painting that shows how music or speech changes over time.
